- [Damu Rafiki](https://example.com/damurafiki): A mobile app that received the 1st position in the Best Project category at my university in 2022.
- [Kibuti Bot](https://example.com/kibutibot): An offline chatbot for students through SMS, which already attained the 1st position in the Best Project of the Year 2023.
- I have also collaborated on various projects, including the [MUST Navigation System](https://example.com/mustnavigation) (a VR-based navigation system for the university) and [Ecoedu](https://example.com/ecoledu) (a mobile app utilizing AR technologies to enhance the learning experience).
